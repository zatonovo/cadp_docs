# Preface

We are witnessing the effects of climate change quickly accelerate.
The consequences of these changes are just starting to be felt.
To avoid widespread suffering, we need to similarly accelerate climate
adaptation initiatives.

The [Climate Adaptation Data Platform (CADP)](https://github.com/zatonovo/zeomancer_system) aims to do just that.
By bringing together multiple stakeholders,
we can solve multiple climate-related challenges concurrently.
This drives down costs and increases reach.

Consistent with the above goal, 
the [CADP is an open source project](https://github.com/zatonovo/zeomancer_system).
This guide details how to use and develop the CADP. 
Those wishing to contribute to the CADP should read this guide first.
Those who only want to use the CADP can skip most of the theory and focus
on the latter half of the book.
