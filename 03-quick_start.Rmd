# Quick Start
The Climate Adaptation Data Platform is a turnkey platform for building 
weather-dependent applications. CADP accelerate food security and public health
initiatives by providing all the infrastructure to automatically incorporate
hyperlocal forecasts as a data source for 

- precision agriculture
- digital advisory services
- heat-health early warning systems
- infectious disease early warning systems

## System Requirements
### Linux
The platform will work on most Debian-based Linux distributions.
At a minimum you need to have the following available:

- bash: this is the command line shell where you can execute commands
- make: this is a standard tool to build software

In a new environment, run the `bin/init_workstation.sh` 
script to ensure you have the tools you need to build the system.

#### Windows users

If your primary operating system is Windows, you will need to install the
Windows Subsystem for Linux. 
[The official instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers)
explains how to install WSL and Docker.

WSL installs the debian flavor of Linux.
Make note of this, as it will help you when troubleshooting in the future.

Once WSL is installed, the following tools need to be installed.
They can be installed via the command line with

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install build-essential postgresql-client
```

(Note: The `$` represents the shell prompt. Do not include it in your command!)




#### Mac users

OS X is built on BSD. Many of the tools have slight differences from GNU Linux.
That said, the system *should* run without issue on Mac OS X.

### Docker

Docker is required. The version used to create this repo is

```
$ docker --version
Docker version 25.0.3, build 4debf41
```

#### Windows
Windows users need to ensure that Docker Desktop is visible in WSL.
There is a setting that enables this behavior.


## Building the Platform
The full platform can be built using the following command:

```
make all
```

This will first build the platform and then launch it. The following tasks
are executed:

- initialize database
- initialize the dashboard
- build all images

You can use this command repeatedly. The `Makefile` is smart enough to know
not to re-initialize the database.

To verify that the system is running, use `docker ps`. This command will show
all the running containers tied to the CADP (nee zeomancer).
The output should look something like this:


```
$ docker ps

```

Alternatively.  you can check the logs for the system using `make logs`.
This will display the current logs for ALL containers in the system.
They will update as the system responds to events.
To exit the log viewer, type Ctrl-C.

To stop the platform, just type `make stop`.
You can restart the platform by running `make run`.
The previous state will be retained when you start back up.


## Platform Demos
A number of demos can be deployed into your running system.
These are not installed by default because we want a clean system 
after initialization.
They also require a lot of weather data,
which is impractical to include with the system.

### Get available demos

This target shows all the available demos and the regions where stations 
can be loaded.

```
make list-demos
```


### Deploy a demo

Deploying a demo means that all source weather data is downloaded and loaded
into the database.
Once the source data are loaded, it is possible to run a simulation to show
how the system state evolves over time or batch run all the forecasting models
and risk rules until an arbitrary end date.
The drawback of the simulator approach is that it will take a while to 
observe.

```
make run-demo
```

During the installation of a demo, you will be prompted to choose whether
to continue with running batch forecasts or not.


### View dashboard

There are two dashboard views. One defines the data processing workflows
and is for application developers. The other is for policymakers and shows
the device network and corresponding weather and application information.

### Reset system

To run another demo, you need to reset the system state. A `make` target
makes this a simple task. Be careful: it also makes it easy to lose all your
work, since it deletes everything in the database!!

```
make reset
```


## Viewing the dashboard
### Policymaker dashboard

The end-user reporting dashboard for decisionmakers and policymakers is 
located at `http://localhost:9002/dashboard/`. 


### System administration dashboard
The workflows that define the processing jobs are defined in Node RED.
They are accessible at `http://localhost:9002/#flow/`.
